# Philosophy and short history

## Philosophy

The acceleration in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) will have a fundamental impact on society, as these technologies are at the core of the tools we use on a daily basis. A considerable part of this effort currently stems in NLP from training increasingly larger language models on increasingly larger quantities of texts.

Unfortunately, the resources necessary to create the best-performing models are found mainly at big technology giants. The stranglehold on this transformative technology poses some problems, from a research advancement, environmental, ethical and societal perspective.

For example, while recent models such as GPT3 (from OpenAI / Microsoft) shows interesting behaviors from a research point of view, such models are private and not accessible to many academic organizations. Moreover, even when accessible, these tools have not been designed as research artifacts and for instance, lack access to the training dataset or checkpoints which makes it impossible to answer many important research questions around these models (capabilities, limitations, potential improvements, bias, ethics, environmental impact, general AI/cognitive research landscape). The current situation also promotes a duplication of energy requirements and environmental costs, due to the duplicated training of large models in private settings. Finally, these models are usually anglo-centric and there are‡ shortcomings in the text corpora used to train these models, ranging from non-representativeness of populations to a predominance of potentially harmful stereotypes or the inclusion of personally-identifying information.

The BigScience project aims to demonstrate another way of creating, studying, and sharing large language models and large research artifacts in general within the AI/NLP research communities.

This project takes inspiration from scientific creation schemes existing in other scientific fields, such as CERN and the LHC in particle physics, in which open scientific collaborations facilitate the creation of large-scale artifacts useful for the entire research community.

Gathering a much larger research community around the creation of these artifacts makes it possible to consider in advance the many research questions (capabilities, limitations, potential improvements, bias, ethics, environmental impact, general AI/cognitive research landscape) that will be interesting to answer with the created artifacts and to reflect and prepare the tools needed to answer as many of these questions as possible.

The BigScience open-science project is seen as a proposal for an international and inclusive way of performing collaborative research. Beyond the research artifacts created and shared, this project thus aims to bring together all the skills, conditions, and lessons allowing such future experiments of large-scale scientific collaboration.

In the end, it’s thus the deep belief of the founding members that the project’s success will ultimately be measured by its long-term impact on the field of NLP and AI: by proposing an alternative way to conduct large scale science project.

## Short history

The “BigScience” project originated from discussions in early 2021 between Thomas Wolf (HuggingFace), Stéphane Requena and Pierre-François Lavallee (respectively from GENCI and IDRIS, both institutions being behind the French supercomputer Jean Zay). Very quickly, members of the science team of HuggingFace (Victor Sanh, Yacine Jernite and all the team) as well as members of the French academic and industrial AI and NLP research communities joined the discussions to further develop the project leading the grant application for 5 millions hours in February 2021.

While BigScience quickly gathered a large French research community surrounding the public compute facility "Jean Zay", ranging from academic laboratories to startups/SMEs and larger industrial groups (identified as the founding members in the members page), it was also clear from the inception of the project that, to propose a more inclusive way to conduct open-research on these large scale artifacts, the international community should be included as soon as possibler and the project should be open and welcome the participants from a large and diverse set of nationalities, cultures, origins and research fields. Following the early grant submission, the funding members of the BigScience project thus started to open and extend the project to an international research community interested in studying and understand better the many research questions surrounding large language models as well as the challenges around creating and sharing such models and datasets for research purposes.

When the project reached more than 200 participants, the organization of the project started to take shape and it was decided to adopt the structure of a research workshop which appeared as one of the most inclusive, flexible and research-community-focused strucutre for research collaboration.

The project is thus now defined as a one-year long research workshop with a set of collaborative tasks around the creation of a large multilingual dataset and a large multilingual language model as detailed on the main page and in the organization documents as detailed on the [main page](index.md) on in the [organization documents](pages/documents.md).

### Pierre-Yves Oudeyer (Research director), Cédric Colas (PhD student), Grgur Kovac (Research engineer), Tristan Karch (PhD student) and the Flowers project-team
Inria, Univ. Bordeaux and Ensta ParisTech
The Flowers team studies models of open-ended development and learning to help us understand better how children learn, and build machines that learn like children. A key topic is language grounding: how can machines learn and use language as a tool to communicate and achieve joint tasks with humans. The large models targeted in this project would be a major asset towards enabling powerful goal imagination and the ability for such systems to be driven by natural language input of non-specialist users (Colas et al., 2020). We also aim to leverage such large models in educational projects where they can be used as tools to foster curiosity (Oudeyer et al., 2016) and learn skills such as question asking (Alaimi et al., 2020) or creative writing.

As computational and corpus linguists we have investigated various generations of distributional semantics models, questioning their use in descriptive linguistics and the intricate relations between training corpora and the resulting models. We need such joint research effort to be able to use large corpora and language models in our work, and thus provide a link between these new artefacts and linguistic research.

### Xavier Tannier (Full professor)
Sorbonne Université, LIMICS (Sorbonne Université, Inserm, Univ. Sorbonne Paris Nord)
My research topics concern natural language processing and information retrieval and extraction, mostly (but not only) in the field of biomedical applications.

Airbus, Central Research & Technology
Airbus has been experimenting with state-of-the-art language models along 2 directions: A/ using pre-trained language models as part of bigger systems for instance to build vocal assistants that accurately answer questions on pilots’ documentation; B/ training language models from scratch on domain-specific data. The model targeted in this project is interesting to us in two aspects: more powerful language models are crucial to transform prototypes into actual services especially when domain specific knowledge is required and handling languages beyond English is critical as Airbus operates in all regions of the world.

### Jean-Michel Dussoux (Technical and innovation director)
Cloud Temple
Cloud Temple has developed a dialogue agent that is able to identify and learn new skills through open-domain conversation with the user without specification of these skills beforehand \citep{Lair20}. While fine-tuning pre-trained models such as BERT offers a solid approach, the zero-shot capabilities of GPT3 allow it to address new challenges such as recognizing the intent of the user by conditioning on a linearized knowledge graph. The model targeted in this project is interesting to us in particular because of its focus on multilingualism (covering French in a non-trivial way) and its ability to handle very long conditionings.

LightOn 
LightOn develops photonic chips for training and running the largest ML models of tomorrow. We cooperate with academic and industrial partners through research collaborations, and by providing access to our photonic co-processors through LightOn Cloud and LightOn Appliance. Extreme-scale NLP models open exciting research directions as well as new business opportunities. However, current trends in model scaling are unsustainable. Hardware innovation, such as the one undertaken at LightOn, is key to make large models more scalable and affordable. Our philosophy is to develop computational hardware at the speed of software. As such, white-box access to a state-of-the-art extreme-scale model, and how it is trained, is an unprecedented opportunity for us to better inform the development of our future hardware.

Nabla
Nabla develops medical software aiming at simplifying the task of healthcare professionals. Observing large inefficiencies in the current healthcare system (patients waiting for the last moment to see a doctor, healthcare professionals wasting a lot of time on bureaucratic tasks), Nabla aims to build software that brings people and healthcare professionals closer, and automatically format health records for doctors. The latter task requires a deep understanding of medical material (such as a discussion between a patient and a healthcare professional), which can only be achieved with the crafting of larger, more powerful text analysis models.

### Matthias Gallé (Lab Manager) and Laurent Besacier (NLP group lead)
Naver Labs Europe
Naver Labs Europe is the largest industrial AI research lab in France. Our research on controlled natural language generation would benefit tremendously from access to a white-box alternative of a large language model and would allow controlling mechanisms out-of-scope with current closed-sourced models. The lack of such access is restricting potential services such as summarization, data-to-text and question answering. Another research direction is to investigate more deeply the zero and few shot capacities of these models for machine translation.

ReciTAL
ReciTAL is a French leader in NLP. My research focuses on natural language generation (NLG) and its automatic evaluation. Language Models have enabled significant progress in the generation of English texts. However, very few works have tested their multilingual ability for generation.

Renault Group, Research & Quality and Customer Satisfaction Department
Since 2015, Group Renault has been studying Text Mining and particularly Natural Language Processing to analyze and understand customer’s feedback coming from various textual sources (call centers, surveys …). They are highly valuable to understand the influence factors of customer satisfaction. We worked on topics such as categorization or search engines to automate and simplify human readings. To do so, we have tested pre-trained language models approaches fine-tuned on our specific corpus and tasks, using among other libraries, transformers. More widely, Renault not only produces cars but also generates a lot of textual data in many languages with a very specific vocabulary. To embed this vocabulary and more generally to embed the associated knowledge, some research activities are currently done in collaboration with IRIT (PhD of R. Soutry).
Training huge language models is unfortunately very expensive and time consuming. We are then interested in participating in this new NLP research initiative.
